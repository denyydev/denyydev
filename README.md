### Frontend Developer (React / Next.js)

I design and build product interfaces with a strong focus on UX, structure,
and long-term maintainability.
Most of my work involves dashboards, admin panels, and e-commerce products
with complex state and real users.

Currently:

- building data-heavy dashboards and admin panels
- working on e-commerce interfaces and conversion-focused product flows
