# Frontend Developer (React / Next.js)

I design and build product interfaces with a strong focus on UX, structure,
and long-term maintainability.
Most of my work involves dashboards, admin panels, and e-commerce products
with complex state and real users.

**Currently:**

- Building data-heavy dashboards and internal tools used in production environments.
- Working on e-commerce interfaces and conversion-focused product flows

## Approach

I prefer fewer features, clearer structure, and predictable behavior
over visual noise. My goal is to reduce cognitive load, not add more UI.
